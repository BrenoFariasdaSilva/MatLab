- **Calculus:** Access MatLab files that demonstrate solutions and applications of calculus concepts, making it a valuable resource for mathematics enthusiasts.

### Why MatLab?

MatLab is a powerful numerical computing environment widely used in academia and industry. Its versatility and rich set of features make it an ideal choice for developing and implementing algorithms in various fields.

## Requirements

Before getting started with the MatLab repository, ensure that you have the following requirements in place:

- **MatLab Installation:** MatLab is the core platform for running the MatLab files in this repository. If you don't have MatLab installed, follow the installation instructions provided below.

### Install MatLab

1. Download Matlab from [Here](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) and download it.
2. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
unzip -qq matlab*.zip -d matlab
cd matlab
sudo ./install
```

3. During the installation process, in the "Options" tab, select "Create Symbolic Links to MATLAB Scripts in" and select the folder `/usr/local/bin`.
4. To run the MATLAB directly using the Command line terminal, we have to create a Symbolic for its script, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ln -s /<path-to-your-matlab>/matlab /usr/local/bin/matlab
```

5. Lastly, install the MatLab Support Package, which also creates the Application Icon, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install matlab-support -y
```


## Setup

### Clone the repository

1. Clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrenoFariasdaSilva/MatLab.git
cd MatLab
```
